OM7 is the latest generation of [OpenMusic](http://repmus.ircam.fr/openmusic/) (OM), a visual programming language based on [Common Lisp](http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/introduction-why-lisp.html). Visual programs are created by assembling and connecting icons representing Lisp functions and data structures, built-in control structures (e.g. loops), and other program constructs.
OM may be used as a general purpose visual programming language, and reuse any existing Common Lisp code.
At a more specialized level, a set of in-built tools and external libraries make it a powerful environment for music composition. Various classes implementing musical structures are provided, associated with graphical editors including common music notation, MIDI, OSC, 2D/3D curves, and audio buffers.
